 CICE Output
*****************************

The ice model produces three types of output data. 

1. A file containing ASCII text, also known as a log file, is created for each run that contains information about how the run was set up and how it progressed. 
See the :ref:`standard output<standard-output>` section.

2. A series of netCDF history files containing gridded instantaneous or time-averaged output are also generated during a run.
See the :ref:`history files<history-files>` section.

3. A series of binary restart files necessary to continue the run are created. 
See the :ref:`restart files<restart-files>` section.

These are described in the following sections.
