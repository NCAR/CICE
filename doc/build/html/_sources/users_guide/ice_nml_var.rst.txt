**********************
 CICE Namelists 
**********************

CICE uses the same namelists for both the coupled and uncoupled models.
This section describes the namelist variables in the namelists,
which determine time management, output frequency, model physics, and
filenames The ice namelists for the coupled model are now located in
**$CASE/CaseDocs**.

A script reads the input namelist at runtime, and writes the namelist
information to the file **ice\_in** in the directory where the model
executable is located. Therefore, the namelist will be updated even if
the ice model is not recompiled. The default values of the ice setup,
grid, tracer, and physics namelists are set in **ice\_init.F90**. The
prescribed ice option along with the history namelist variables are set
in **ice\_prescribed.F90** and **ice\_history.F90** respectively. If
they are not set in the namelist in the script, they will assume the
default values listed in the following tables, which
list all available namelist parameters. The default values shown here
are for the coupled model, which is set up for a production run. Only a
few of these variables are required to be set in the namelist; these
values are noted in the paragraphs below. An example of the default
namelist is shown in Section :ref:`cice_namelist_examples`.

The main run management namelist options are shown in :ref:`setupnml`. 
While additional namelist variables are
available in the uncoupled version, they are set by the driver in
CESM. For a full list of namelist variables, you should consult the CICE
Reference Guide :cite:`cice15`. 

Variables set by the driver include: ``dt``, ``runid``, ``runtype``, ``istep0``,
``days_per_year``, ``restart`` and ``dumpfreq``. These should be changed in the
CESM configuration files.

   ==================    ==========  ====================        ============================================================ 

Changing the timestep
---------------------

``dt`` is the timestep in seconds for the ice model thermodynamics. The
thermodynamics component is stable but not necessarily accurate for any
value of the timestep. The value chosen for ``dt`` depends on the stability
of the transport and the grid resolution. A conservative estimate of ``dt``
for the transport using the upwind advection scheme is:

.. math:: \Delta t < \frac{min(\Delta x, \Delta y)}{4 max(u, v)} .

Maximum values for ``dt`` for the two standard CESM POP grids, assuming
:math:`max(u,v) = 0.5\ m/s`, are shown in :ref:`timestep`.
The default timestep for CICE is 30 minutes for gx1, 
which must be equvialent to the coupling interval (``NCPL_ICE`` and ``NCPL_ATM``) 
set in the CESM configuration files **env\_run.xml**.

.. _timestep:

.. csv-table:: Table 2: Recommended timesteps
   :header: "Grid",":math:`min(\Delta x, \Delta y)`",":math:`max \Delta t`"
   :widths: 20,60,20

   gx3,28845.9 m,4.0 hr
   gx1,8558.2 m,1.2 hr

Occasionally, ice velocities are calculated that are larger than what is
assumed when the model timestep is chosen. This causes a CFL violation
in the transport scheme. A namelist option was added (``ndtd``) to
subcycle the dynamics to get through these instabilities that arise
during long integrations. The default value for this variable is one,
and is typically increased to two when the ice model reaches an
instability. The value in the namelist should be returned to one by the
user when the model integrates past that point.

Writing Output
--------------

The namelist variables that control the frequency of the model
diagnostics, netCDF history, and restart files are shown in
:ref:`setupnml`. By default, diagnostics are written out once
every 48 timesteps to the ascii file **ice.log.$LID** (see section
:ref:`standard-output`). $LID is a time stamp that is set in the main script.

The namelist variable histfreq controls the output frequency of the
netCDF history files; writing monthly averages is the default. The
content of the history files is described in section :ref:`history-files`. The
value of ``hist_avg`` determines if instantaneous or averaged variables are
written at the frequency set by ``histfreq``. If ``histfreq`` is set to ``1`` for
instantaneous output, ``hist_avg`` is set to ``.false.`` within the source code
to avoid conflicts. The latest version of CICE allows for multiple
history streams, currently set to a maximum of 5. The namelist
variables, ``histfreq`` and ``histfreq_n`` are now arrays which allow for
different frequency history file sets. More detail on this is available
in :ref:`history-files`.

The namelist variable ``pointer_file`` is set to the name of the pointer
file containing the restart file name that will be read when model
execution begins. The pointer file resides in the scripts directory and
is created initially by the ice setup script but is overwritten every
time a new restart file is created. It will contain the name of the
latest restart file. The default filename **ice.restart\_file** shown in
:ref:`setupnml` will not work unless some modifications
are made to the ice setup script and a file is created with this name
and contains the name of a valid restart file; this variable must be set
in the namelist. More information on restart pointer files can be found
in Section :ref:`restart-files`.

The variables ``dumpfreq`` and ``dumpfreq_n`` control the output frequency of
the netCDF restart files; writing one restart file per year is the
default and is set by the CESM driver. The default format for all reads and 
writes of files in CESM is now pio, but this can be changed to binary or
netCDF through the namelist variable, ``restart_format``. 

The Parallel Input/Output libraries or "PIO" are used within the CESM for more
efficient reading and writing. PIO includes options for binary, netCDF version3,
parallel netCDF, or netCDF version 4 parallel. More on this can be found here:

http://ncar.github.io/ParallelIO/

If ``print_points`` is ``.true.``, diagnostic data is printed out for two grid
points, one near the north pole and one near the Weddell Sea. The points
are set via namelist variables ``latpnt`` and ``lonpnt``. This option can be
helpful for debugging.

Model Physics
-------------

Some of the most commonly used namelist variables for the ice model physics 
are listed in the following tables. More information can be found in the 
CICE reference guide at :cite:`cice15`.

The calculation of the ice velocities is subcycled ``ndte`` times per
timestep so that the elastic waves are damped before the next timestep.
The subcycling timestep is calculated as :math:`dte = dt/ndte` and must be
sufficiently smaller than the damping timescale T, which needs to be
sufficiently shorter than dt.

.. math:: dte < T < dt

This relationship is discussed in :cite:`cice15`. The best
ratio for [dte : T : dt] is [1 : 40 : 120]. Typical combinations of dt
and ndte are (3600., 120), (7200., 240) (10800., 120). The default ``ndte``
is ``120`` as set in **ice\_init.F90**.

``kitd`` determines the scheme used to redistribute sea ice within the ice
thickness distribution (ITD) as the ice grows and melts. The linear
remapping scheme is the default and approximates the thickness
distribution in each category as a linear function (). The delta
function method represents *g(h)* in each category as a delta function
(). This method can leave some categories mostly empty at any given time
and cause jumps in the properties of *g(h)*.

``kdyn`` determines the ice dynamics used in the model. The default is the
elastic-viscous-plastic (EVP) dynamics . If ``kdyn`` is set to ``0``, the ice
dynamics is inactive. In this case, ice velocities are not computed and
ice is not transported. Since the initial ice velocities are read in
from the restart file, the maximum and minimum velocities written to the
log file will be non-zero in this case, but they are not used in any
calculations.

The value of ``kstrength`` determines which formulation is used to calculate
the strength of the pack ice. The calculation depends on mean ice
thickness and open water fraction. The calculation of is based on
energetics and should not be used if the ice that participates in
ridging is not well resolved.

The variable ``advection`` determines the horizontal transport scheme used. The default
scheme is the incremental remapping method (). This method is less
diffusive and is computationally efficient for large numbers of
categories or tracers. The upwind scheme is also available. The upwind
scheme is only first order accurate.

A new thermodynamics option (``ktherm = 2``) is now the default. This is the
so-called mushy-layer thermodyanmics of :cite:`turner15`. The basic
idea of this is that prognostic salinity is now used in the vertical
thermodynamic calculation where this used to be a constant profile. The
CESM1 and older option of :cite:`bitz99`, (``ktherm = 1``) is still available.
There are several additional thermodynamic options not listed that go with 
``ktherm = 2``, that are described more thoroughly in :cite:`cice15`.

   ``conduct``,"Character","MU71","Determines conductivity formulation used with ktherm = 1, MU71, bubbly"

For the newer delta-Eddington shortwave radiative transfer scheme ``shortwave = dEdd``, the
base albedos are computed based on the inherent optical properties of
snow, sea ice, and melt ponds. These albedos are most commonly changed through
adjustments to the snow grain radius, ``R_snw``, temperature to transition
to melting snow, ``dT_mlt_in``, and maximum snow grain radius, ``rsnw_mlt_in``. Note, the older CCSM3
radiation scheme is still available through ``shortwave = default``.

Grid Namelist
-------------

The namelist parameters listed in :ref:`grid` are for
grid and mask information. During execution, the ice model reads grid
and land mask information from the files ``grid_file`` and ``kmt_file`` that
should be located in the executable directory. There are commands in the
scripts that copy these files from the input data directory, rename them
from **global\_$ICE\_GRID.grid** and **global\_$ICE\_GRID.kmt** to the
default filenames shown in :ref:`grid`.

For coupled runs, supported grids include the ’displaced\_pole’ grids
(gx3 and gx1) and the ’tripole’ grids.

Domain Namelist
---------------

The namelist parameters listed in :ref:`domain` are
for computational domain decomposition information. These are generally
set in the build configure scripts through the variables ``CICE_DECOMPTYPE`` 
and ``CICE_DECOMPSETTING`` based on the number of processors.
See the CESM scripts documentation.
